This project was done following a beginner's course to vue 3.0, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqgiuPt5QZo">Vue 3 Course</a> made by <a href="https://github.com/MitchellRomney">Mitchell Romney</a>, using its new Composition API.

This is just a simple project, with the intuit of using some of the vue's concepts. I might delve deep into this application later, trying to make something more appealing, and complex, but for now, i'll leave it as it is, though, my project is a bit different from the one built in the course.
